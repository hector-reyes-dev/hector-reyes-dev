# H√©ctor Reyes | Strategic Product Maker

I'm a Product Maker who bridges the gap between conceptual vision and technical execution. My mission is to build digital products that solve real-world problems by merging systems design, software development, and business strategy. I don't just write code; I build systems, design experiences, and take full ownership of a product's success, from the first line of code to the final user validation. My philosophy is simple: stop consuming, start creating.
